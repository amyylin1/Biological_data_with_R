Suppose the sytolic blook pressure of a hypertension patient follows a normal distribution with 
mean 150
standard deviation of 10

# 1. simulate the data assuming that the drug has no effect

```{r}
set.seed(1)

before_treatment <- rnorm(10, mean = 150, sd = 10)

after_treatment <- rnorm(10, mean = 150, sd = 10)

result <- t.test(before_treatment, after_treatment, paired = TRUE, alternative = 'greater')
result
```

```{r}
result$p.value
```

# 2. generate p-val

```{r}
set.seed(1)

pvals = numeric(10000) # do the simulation 10, 000 times

for (i in 1:10000){
      before_treatment <- rnorm(10, mean = 150, sd = 10)
      after_treatment <- rnorm(10, mean = 150, sd = 10)
      pvals[i] = t.test(before_treatment, after_treatment, paired = TRUE, alternative = 'greater')$p.value
}
```


```{r}
pvals
```

# 3. distribution of p-vals
```{r}
hist(pvals, breaks=30)
```
